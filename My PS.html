         What comes to mind when you hear the word "parasite"? Perhaps you picture a tiny organism thriving at the expense of its host, or maybe you think of the film that won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. For me, it means both—and even more. It’s the word that best describes us: two young girls crashing at an acquaintance's house, desperately searching for a place to belong.
      
         <br>From as early as I can remember, I was aware that my family was different from others—we never had a home of our own. Growing up, I became accustomed to our constant search for a place to live, moving from one rented space to another, often sharing tight quarters. By the time I reached seventh grade, our small bedroom could no longer accommodate all of us, prompting my parents to arrange for my sister and me to stay with my aunt. It was happiness at first, having my own room and sleeping soundly without being cramped in a crowded bed. But no matter how hard we made this live-in thing work, it was all in vain. In the end, we had to concede that somehow, we were indeed "parasites."</br>
         
         <br>The memory of that day remains as vivid as if it were yesterday. One frigid winter night, bundled in my cozy blanket and nose buried in my favorite novel, I overheard my aunt on a phone call. Wouldn’t it have caught my attention if I had not heard someone on the other end warning my aunt about us, stamping my sister and me as “nothing more than two parasites who would only bring her trouble.” The word “parasites” struck me like a blow, leaving me momentarily speechless. Even at the age of twelve, I knew it was no compliment to call anybody a parasite as it meant that the person lived on victuals provided by another human being. And herein, that word was applied to us, two harmless little girls.</br>
         
         <br>In a moment of disbelief, I fled the house, my mind numb and my hands trembling. I strolled aimlessly through the brightly lit streets as my thoughts swirled with questions: Why was this happening? Why did we deserve such disdain? Why were we even here? Tears started to stream down my face, blurring my vision. The night was biting, but I hardly felt it; the chill in the air was nothing compared to the coldness of the word, which had already dulled my senses. At that moment, something within me ignited—a fierce desire to change my life.</br>
         
         <br>As I matured, the questions never stopped lingering in my mind for a day over the past five years, pushing me to reflect on the larger social issues at play. I now believe that I have partly discovered the answer: it was never my fault, nor my family’s. The problem lay in the market itself. The persistent housing shortage, combined with a slow rise in income, has made it difficult for many low-to-middle-income families to find proper accommodation, resulting in a generation that cannot afford homeownership. This nagging situation challenges the traditional norm of “an cư lạc nghiệp” (having a home as the foundation for a stable life and career) and leads to serious social issues.</br>
         
         <br>Once again, a passion within me awoke—a drive to help families like mine and children like me find a home they can call their own. Acknowledging that meaningful change should start from within, I devoted myself during high school to not only achieving academic excellence but also to various extracurricular activities that honed my skills and shaped my character. One of the highlights of this experience was Inspiration Day 2023, a program designed to welcome and motivate new students at my school. As a member of the Finance and External Relations Department, I was responsible for cultivating and maintaining strong relationships with our sponsors. This involved regular communication to ensure their continued support, addressing their needs and inquiries, and coordinating sponsorship agreements. Drawing from prior job experience, I managed these engagements effectively and successfully secured sponsorships from three major sponsors, which collectively contributed 40% of the funding needed for our annual event.</br>
         
         <br>After a year, my commitment paid off when I was elected as the head of the department. Leading for the first time, I encountered numerous challenges, the biggest being a crucial moment when securing sponsors for our main events proved difficult. With only two weeks to go and no responses from the more than 100 businesses we had contacted, my team’s morale was at an all-time low. As the deadline loomed, I felt the pressure mount—without sponsorships, our event would suffer, possibly forcing us to increase the participation fee, which could significantly reduce attendance.</br>
         
         <br>Determined to overcome this setback, I rallied my team and reworked our strategy. We shifted from mass email outreach to focusing on a targeted list of the five most promising prospects, reaching out directly to their managers with personalized proposals. Finally, we received replies requesting more details, and soon, all five businesses engaged in negotiations with us. In the end, we secured sponsorships totaling 50 million VND, allowing us to host a successful event for 600 participants at an affordable entry fee. This experience taught me that with determination and resilience, any goal can be achieved, even as far-fetched as my dream of owning a home.</br>
         
         <br>On my journey to realizing my dream, I aspire to study Business Administration with a concentration in Real Estate at the National University of Singapore (NUS). As a global hub for finance, trade, and innovation, Singapore offers a unique environment to explore sustainable and forward-thinking real estate solutions. With its well-regulated property market and progressive urban planning strategies, the country provides an ideal setting for me to gain insights into effective housing policies and market dynamics.</br>
        
         <br>At NUS, I am eager to contribute to the university’s dynamic learning environment by engaging in student-led initiatives, research projects, and industry collaborations that tackle pressing real estate challenges. My background in Finance and External Relations has honed my organizational and communication skills, and I aim to leverage these experiences to participate in business case competitions, real estate clubs, and entrepreneurship initiatives. By immersing myself in these opportunities, I hope to develop innovative solutions that make housing more accessible and sustainable—turning my personal experiences into impactful contributions to society.</br>
