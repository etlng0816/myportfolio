        <h1>Welcome to Whispers of Words</h1>
        <p>I possess a boundless imagination that allows me to dream of a world with no wars, no poverty, and plenty of harmony and mutual support. Imagination for me is not flights of fancy; it's the connecting device between what is and what could be. Seeing communities bonded through a sense of purpose, each person contributing their piece of the tapestry that is progressing with compassion is what I often dream about. Anything but a wishful daydream, it is more of a wake-up call to the rude realities of today's world. It stirs in me an ardor, fosters change, and whets my determination to make this imagination real. A compass, it guides me toward new paths, and yet, at the same time, it can become a catalyst to help me let others be inspired in the same journey. This is the prism of endless possibility from which I draw the strength to forge ahead in the work of translating ideals into action and dreams into reality.</p>

            <h3>Mother's Love</h3>
            <p>What is the sky where there are no stars?</p>
            <button onclick="togglePoem('poem1')">Read More</button>
            <p id="poem1" class="full-poem" style="display: none;">What is the sky where there are no stars?
What is the sea where there are no fishes?
What we can’t touch though we know it’s not far?
What we can’t see though we know it exists?
What we can just feel and receive it
from its only owner?—our greatest mother.
It’s something that can’t be defined
Something that can’t be derived from us
Something that cannot be judged
As it’s precious
Than any other things.
It comes from where all the lives start
And won’t disappear even if the lives end
It’s the sun helping us overcome things that are harsh
And guides us whenever we lose our directions.
It’s mother’s love
which is higher than sky and larger than sea
which we can feel or receive
but cannot touch or see.

            <p id="poem2" class="full-poem" style="display: none;">2020 - The year full of turbulence
Stir up the race of the human 
But now at this moment
We're here with our confidence
In solving this situation
And welcoming the new year
Without tears,
Fears,
And regrets.

            <button onclick="togglePoem('poem3')">Read More</button>
            <p id="poem3" class="full-poem" style="display: none;">Another challenging year rolled by,
There were people exhausted,
and there were people died...
Another fight with an unknown ending,
A fight against issues that are nagging.
Another year witnessed many an event,
From the cry for help of Mother Earth,
To the impotent tears of youths from Afghanistan.
But as it's usually said
everything has both sides,
2021, for sure, is not besides...
It was the year when sportsmanship surpassed the pandemic,
It was the year of the first commercial flight into the space,
And the opening of a new era for mankind.
It was also the year when all limits were broken, with technology.
That's why we have the right to believe in a brighter 2022,
When wars and epidemics will be eradicated,
           When the world is only the world of peace and joy.

            <p id="poem4" class="full-poem" style="display: none;">One year down, one year to go
Many a party, to be thrown
Dancing the night away, why don't you so
Then having a hangover, will you bros?
Out with the old, in with the new
Turn over a new leaf, our purview
No need to worry, or to steer (clear of the future)
Cause what comes will come
What must be, must be
And we have the right to hope, definitely 
For a lovely-dovey New Year
As what they did in the days of Auld Lang Syne
With a glass of bubbly at midnight
  "Happy New Year, oh my dears !"

            <p id="poem5" class="full-poem" style="display: none;">When it chimed the midnight
I saw it dimmed the moonlight
As I followed the fireworks
I found something out of the world.
That is the time of the year
At which the future appears
Albeit people all cheer
I just feel so drear.
Hitherto poetry had long thewed
Ring out the old, ring in the new
But it seems to be askew
The future without you.
I wonder whether it is a fate
To start with a clean slate
And it brings me heartache
Whenever I contemplate.
It leaves me to ponder tho
How deeply was I preoccupied
In thy dovey ardor
In thy fervency galore. 
My dream of its fondest
Telling deity in the starlit
Not to shake things up a bit
               Not to mess things up a whit.

            <p>Today is the first day of the rest of my life</p>
            <button onclick="togglePoem('poem6')">Read More</button>
            <p id="poem6" class="full-poem" style="display: none;">Today is the first day of the rest of my life
under the past, I draw a line
no longer weep or dwell on cry
my future beckons with hopes so rife.
The highs and lows, they’ve sapped my might,
out of me, they’ve scared a daylight
But courage sparks in the dead of night
Trials faced, endless fight, and my path alight.
Soon I realized nothing ventured, nothing gained
without the leap, the dream’s constrained
Having transcended pain, I opened the door to
the endeavors that I had long wooed.
I give a crap about moments that last,
not the crap of regrets that belong to the past
Turn the page, guide the sage
to ring in the new and ring out the aged.
Like a lighthouse, I flashily dressed
take in a breath of air that’s fresh
with every step, my spirit’s blessed
A change, it is, as good as a rest.
Be there with bells on, I’ll laugh and shine
through ups and downs, this path is mine
with every challenge, I’ll rise and strive,
so I wreathe my pride in gold
               for the rest of my life.

            <p id="poem7" class="full-poem" style="display: none;">A glance, a plan, an orchestrated chance
Smitten, I stand, with my heart remanded
It was only then that I comprehended
what lay between us was beyond friend
‘It has kept me up for nights & days
lingering in my headspace’,
and it takes my breath away
as thou talk, my mind ablaze
Thou dropped the L bomb, dreamily
Engulfed me in redamancy
Oh! My one and only
In thy embrace, I long to be.
Thy words of endearment
Instilled in me a belief fervent
that me and thee, certain
is a match made in heaven.
Love makes my world go round
in ways I cannot count
But also it helps me surmount
the hurdles scattered around.
Oh! My type on paper
I see thou fear the future
But my dearest lover,
Absence makes our hearts grow fonder.
Oh! The love of my life
The one sets my heart alight
My only ride-or-die
               In thy touch, I’m forever tied.
